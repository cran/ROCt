Description: Contains functions in order to estimate diagnostic and prognostic capacities of continuous markers. More precisely, one function concerns the estimation of time-dependent ROC (ROCt) curve, as proposed by Heagerty et al. (2000) <DOI: 10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00337.x>. One function concerns the adaptation of the ROCt theory for studying the capacity of a marker to predict the excess of mortality of a specific population compared to the general population. This last part is based on additive relative survival models and the work of Pohar-Perme et al. (2012) <DOI: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01640.x>. We also propose two functions for cut-off estimation in medical decision making by maximizing time-dependent expected utility function. Finally, we propose confounder-adjusted estimators of ROC and ROCt curves by using the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) approach.  For the confounder-adjusted ROC curve (without censoring), we also proposed the implementation of the estimator based on placement values proposed by Pepe and Cai (2004) <DOI: 10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00200.x>.
